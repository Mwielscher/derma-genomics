## About this Repository  
This repository gives detailed instructions on how to use [Google Life Science API](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/reference/rest) in connection with GATK best practices workflows from within the European Union. Workflows are written in [workflow description language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) and run by [cromwell workflow engine](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) both developed and maintained at Broad Institute. The goal of this code repository is to get from [uBAM files](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532132-uBAM-Unmapped-BAM-Format)(i.e. raw files from WGS run) to [VCF files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf) in standardized and reproducible environment.
